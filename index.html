<h3><strong> here is a brief introduction of who I am  </strong><img src="https://htmlcodeeditor.com/images/smiley.png" alt="smiley" /></h3>
<body>
I am a 28 y/o transfer student at UCSD from just outside of Chicago. I was stationed in California back in 2010 when I joined the USMC as a weapons mechanic till 2014. I joined the service so I could better understand who I was and what I was capable of. In addition I wanted to obtain the GI bill so I could get finacial assistance to go to university when the time came. My main goals in life are to create, explore and help people. I love to build anything from software to lighting fixtures. I started wood working seriously when I bought a 1980s school bus to turn into a rv that I traveled the states in. I aslo travled the states by motorcycle. I have also traveled to many countries to explore cities and others to hike mountains. I bought a house in 2015 and have since been interested in renovation and investing in properties. After this I started my path on higher education and intrestest in the tech fields  I love all programming languages and see them as tools to complete tasks. Some work better than others for given tasks. I mainly use python, java, c and c++
below is a link to my instagram to see some cool stuff I have done and seen!
